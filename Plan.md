# Plan of stuff to add

## Short tier things to add 
* Gold dropping when ever the player defeats the computer
* Add more cards to the list avaliable
* Add levels to both the player and computer which effects the amount of health they both have and the amount of gold dropped

## Mid tier things to add
* Making it so that once a card is drawn by either the player or computer it is not avalaible to the other
* Changing the battle system so that rather going until the player or computer loses, the battle ends after 5 rounds and player has a limited set of cards to choose from

## Long tier things to add
* A shop system were the player can purchase cards to add their inventory
* A player inventory that holds the cards that that player has either drawn randomly or bought.
* A save system saving the players current gold and cards they have in their inventory
